# Guesser-Game

The Number Guessing Game is a Java-based console application that involves a Guesser and three Players. The Guesser starts by entering a number, and then each Player provides their own guesses. The goal is for the Players to match their guesses with the Guesser's number. The Umpire, responsible for comparing the guesses, declares the winner or winners based on the outcomes.

The game evaluates multiple scenarios, checking if the Guesser's number matches any of the Players' guesses. It handles ties, where all three Players guess correctly, as well as various combinations of winners when only one or two Players match the Guesser. The Umpire outputs messages to the console, declaring the game's outcome, whether it's a tied game, a single winner, or multiple winners.

To play the game, users compile and run the Java application, follow the on-screen instructions, and enter their guesses when prompted. The simplicity and interactivity of the game make it a fun and engaging exercise for players to test their guessing skills and luck.
